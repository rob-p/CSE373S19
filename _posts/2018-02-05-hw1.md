Homework 1 will become visible Feb 5, 2018 right after class.  This homework is due Feb 16, 2018 by 11:59 PM.
You can obtain the homework from Blackboard.  The homework should be submitted via Blackboard, and should
be typeset.  You need not use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), but learning it may make typesetting some solutions easier.
