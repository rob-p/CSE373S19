The recommended reading for lecture 7 is 5.5 of the book and the [Linear work suffix array construction paper](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/tpkarkka/publications/jacm05-revised.pdf).
There is also a nice [blog post](http://spencer-carroll.com/the-dc3-algorithm-made-simple/) on DC3 for those wanting another exposition as well.
