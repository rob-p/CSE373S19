The recommended reading for lectures 9 and 10 is sections 6.6 and 6.7 of the book.  Note that we will cover two topics (general gap penalties and
affine gap penalties) that are not in the K&T book. If you want to read a resource on this topic apart from the slides, it is covered in 
section 1.7 of "Handbook of Computational Molecular Biology" (Aluru), which can be views via e.g. Google Books.
