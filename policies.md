**Coursework and grading**: The coursework will consist of three exams, two midterms and a final. In addition there will be approximately 5-7 homework assignments, and the lowest homework grade will be dropped when computing the contribution of homeworks to your final grade. The breakdown of weights for these different assignments will be as follows:

- Midterm 1 — 25%
- Midterm 2 - 25%
- Final — 30%
- Homeworks — 20%

**Homeworks**: Homeworks are due _by the of class_ on the due date and are to be turned in electronically.  All homeworks (with the exception of a possible programming assignment) must be typeset, preferrably using LaTeX.  You are _encouraged_ to discuss the problems and solutions with your classmates, but you must write up your solutions yourself.  That is, it is acceptable to discuss how to approach or solve a problem with a classmate, but you should not sit with them when writing up the solution, and the solution should be written using your own words (you may not write up a solution from shared notes).  Also, if you discuss a homework problem with someone in the course, then **list these collaborators** at the top of the first page on the assignment you turn in.

**Late policy**: Late assignments will not be accepted.

**Regrade policy**: All requests to re-grade, re-check, or re-mark an assignment or exam question **must be made in writing**. When the assignment is re-graded, it will be re-checked in its entirety. This means that *it is possible to lose points on other problems if they were graded incorrectly or too leniently the first time*. Therefore, I urge you to thoroughly consider each regrade request you make.

**Excused Absences**: If you miss a class for a medical or health-related reason, please provide me with a record of this in writing or via e-mail (I do not need to know the specifics, just the date of your absence and that it was for a medical or health reason). If, for a health-related or medical reason, you will miss two or more consecutive classes, or will miss class on a recurring basis, or were unable to meet a particular academic obligation of this course, I will require a written note from the Student Health Service or a healthcare provider documenting the range of dates for which you were unable to meet your academic obligations. This note need not contain any diagnostic information. If you will miss any classes or scheduled exams as a result of religious observances, you must submit this information to me, in writing, within the first two weeks of the semester to make necessary accommodations to complete the work that will be missed.

**Academic integrity**: [From the University’s Academic Integrity Syllabus Statement](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/academic_integrity/syllstate.html):

> Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person’s work as your own is always wrong. Any suspected instance of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Academic Judiciary. For more comprehensive information on academic integrity, including categories of academic dishonesty, please refer to the academic judiciary website at www.stonybrook.edu/academicintegrity.

Academic integrity is a very serious issue. Any assignment, project or exam you complete in this course is expected to be your own work. If you are allowed to discuss the details of or work together on an assignment, this will be made explicit. Otherwise, you are expected to complete the work yourself. *Plagarism is not just the outright copying of content*. If you paraphrase someone else's thoughts, words, or ideas and you don't cite your source, this constitues plagraism (i.e. this is just as bad as copying someone's answer on an exam or code on a homework). It is always much better to turn in an incorrect or incomplete assignment representing your own efforts than to attempt to pass off the work of another as your own. I have a lot of tolerance for those who are making a significant effort but may be having trouble understanding a particular concept or completing a certain assignment. However, there will be no tolerance of academic dishonesty. **If you are academically dishonest in this course, you will recieve a grade of F, and you will be reported to the department's academic integrity committee**.

**Learning disabilities**: If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact Disability Support Services, ECC (Educational Communications Center) Building, room 128, (631) 632-6748. They will determine with you what accommodations, if any, are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential
